I am a graduate of the [U.C. Berkeley Statistics Department](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/). My PhD advisor was [Jon McAuliffe](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/jon-mcauliffe-0). I was grateful to have been supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

Previously, I graduated from Duke University in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics.
